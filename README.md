# Increased N6-Methyladenosine in Fetal Offspring following Gestational Nano-TiO2 Inhalation Exposure Decreases Mitochondrial Transcript and Protein Expression

## Background
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prominent epitranscriptomic modification in eukaryotes, but itâ€™s implications on adaptive changes within the gestational environment are poorly understood. We propose that cardiac m6A methylation in fetal offspring exposed gestationally to nano-TiO2 alters mitochondrial bioenergetics through changes in mRNA and protein stability.

## Methods
10-week-old female FVB/NJ wild type mice (n=14) were purchased. Mice were mated and on gestational day (GD) 5 underwent 6 non-consecutive days of whole-body inhalation exposure. Mice were exposed to filtered room air or nano-TiO2 with a target aerosol mass concentration of 12 mg/m3. At GD 15 mice were sacrificed and cardiac RNA and mitochondrial proteins extracted. Immunoprecipitation with m6A antibodies was performed followed by sequencing of immunoprecipitant (m6A) and input (mRNA) on the Illumina NextSeq 2000. Protein extraction, preparation, and LC-MS/MS was used for mitochondrial protein quantification.
